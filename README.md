Soccer exercise
---------------

Your task is to create an app, which visualizes players' positions on a soccer field. 
See the file `movie.mov` for an example.
Provide a README.md file if you wish to add comments about your app.

Attached files:
- `data.js` - player positions data
- `index.html` - example index file
- `movie.mov` - a movie of an app with the desired functionalities
- `soccer.png` - soccer field image

App functionalities:
- play/pause button
- soccer field with moving players
- each player on the field must be represented as a circle with a player's id inside it
- passed time and total time counters
- slider, which changes the current time and players positions on the field

Additional functionalities:
- player position frames are provided at 100ms interval, which is *not* frequent enough to achieve a smooth playback. Provide a solution, which animates or fixes this behavior

Notes:
- do not focus on graphic design, or try to replicate the app from `movie.mov` exactly - only the functionalities are important
- be aware of the time you have and implement only the functionalities you can finish
- your app is required to work on *any* one of the latest web browsers - so you can use modern language features (like ES6) as you wish
